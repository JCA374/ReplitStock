# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

Your app is now configured to work perfectly with Streamlit Cloud. Here's what was fixed and how to deploy:

## What Was Fixed

✓ **Port Configuration**: Set to 8501 (Streamlit Cloud standard)
✓ **Server Settings**: Added proper headless and CORS configuration  
✓ **Requirements File**: Created `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
✓ **Runtime Specification**: Added `runtime.txt` for Python 3.11
✓ **Package Dependencies**: Added `packages.txt` for system packages
✓ **Secrets Template**: Created `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example`
✓ **Duplicate Import**: Fixed duplicate import causing startup errors

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
Make sure all files are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

### 2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Click "New app"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select your repository and branch
5. Set main file path: `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Configure Secrets (Optional)
If you want live data, add these secrets in Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
```toml
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
SUPABASE_URL = "your_url_here" 
SUPABASE_KEY = "your_key_here"
```

## Key Files for Deployment

- `app.py` - Main application
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `runtime.txt` - Python version (3.11)
- `packages.txt` - System packages
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` - Secrets template

## VS Code Compatibility Preserved

All VS Code functionality remains intact:
- Setup scripts (`setup-windows.bat`, `setup-linux-mac.sh`)
- VS Code configuration (`.vscode/` folder)
- Debug and launch configurations
- Quick tasks for development

## App Features

The deployed app includes:
- Batch stock analysis with Swedish market focus
- Technical and fundamental analysis
- Watchlist management
- Company explorer
- Works offline with cached SQLite data
- Optional live data with API keys

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check GitHub repository has all files
2. Verify `requirements.txt` is in root directory
3. Ensure no missing import dependencies
4. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors

Your app will work immediately after deployment, even without API keys, using the existing SQLite database with cached stock data.
