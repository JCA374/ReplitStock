## Stock Analysis Summary: Value & Momentum Strategy

The core analysis in this application combines two investment approaches:

### Technical Analysis (Momentum)

1. **Trend Analysis**:
   - **Primary Trend**: Uses the 40-week moving average (MA40) as the key trend indicator
     - Price above MA40 = bullish primary trend
     - Price below MA40 = bearish primary trend
   
   - **Short-Term Momentum**: 4-week moving average (MA4) for recent price action
     - Price above MA4 = positive short-term momentum
     - Crossing above MA4 can be an early entry signal

2. **Momentum Indicators**:
   - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Measures the speed and magnitude of price movements
     - RSI > 50 indicates bullish momentum
     - RSI < 50 indicates bearish momentum
     - Extreme readings (>70 or <30) can indicate overbought/oversold conditions

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - **Higher Lows**: Identifies strengthening uptrends through price structure
   - **Near 52-Week High**: Indicates strong performance relative to recent history
   - **Breakouts**: Detects price breaking out of consolidation patterns

### Fundamental Analysis (Value)

1. **Profitability Check**:
   - Is the company profitable? (Basic quality filter)

2. **Valuation Metrics**:
   - **P/E Ratio**: Price relative to earnings
     - Lower P/E generally suggests better value (with caveats)
     - The app checks against a maximum threshold (e.g., P/E < 30)

3. **Growth Metrics**:
   - **Revenue Growth**: Is the company growing its top line?
   - **Profit Margin**: How efficiently is revenue converted to profit?

### Combined Analysis & Signals

The strategy generates a "Tech Score" (0-100) based on technical indicators and performs a binary "fundamental check" (pass/fail) on the value metrics.

Final signals are determined by combining both approaches:

- **BUY Signal**: 
  - Tech Score â‰¥ 70 AND
  - Passes fundamental check

- **SELL Signal**:
  - Tech Score < 40 OR
  - Below MA40 (primary trend turned negative)

- **HOLD Signal**:
  - Everything in between

This balanced approach looks for stocks that are fundamentally sound (value) but also have positive price momentum (trend) - attempting to avoid both "value traps" (cheap stocks that keep getting cheaper) and momentum chasing without fundamental backing.

The strategy is particularly useful for medium to long-term investors who want technical timing for fundamentally sound companies.
