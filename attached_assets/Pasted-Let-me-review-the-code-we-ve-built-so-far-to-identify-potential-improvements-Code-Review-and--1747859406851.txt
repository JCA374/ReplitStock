Let me review the code we've built so far to identify potential improvements:

## Code Review and Improvement Suggestions

### 1. Data Access Layer (`get_data_from_both_dbs`)

**Current Implementation:**
- Sequentially checks Supabase first, then SQLite
- Returns the first valid data it finds
- Basic error handling

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Parallel Data Retrieval**: Fetch from both databases simultaneously to reduce waiting time
- **Data Merging**: Instead of prioritizing one source, intelligently merge data from both sources when both are available
- **Caching Layer**: Add an in-memory cache to avoid repeated database calls for the same ticker
- **Error Recovery**: Add more robust error handling with specific actions for different error types

```python
async def get_data_from_both_dbs_async(self, ticker, timeframe='1wk', period='1y'):
    """Fetch data from both databases asynchronously and merge results."""
    # Use asyncio to fetch simultaneously
    supabase_task = asyncio.create_task(self._get_supabase_data(ticker, timeframe, period))
    sqlite_task = asyncio.create_task(self._get_sqlite_data(ticker, timeframe, period))
    
    # Await both results
    supabase_result = await supabase_task
    sqlite_result = await sqlite_task
    
    # Intelligently merge the results
    return self._merge_data_sources(supabase_result, sqlite_result)
```

### 2. Ranking System

**Current Implementation:**
- Good weighting system for technical and fundamental factors
- Handles missing data appropriately
- Normalizes scores to 0-100 scale

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Adjust weights based on market conditions (e.g., higher weight on fundamentals in bear markets)
- **Sector-Specific Ranking**: Different sectors should have different criteria importance (e.g., P/E more important for value stocks)
- **Outlier Handling**: Add percentile-based normalization to handle extreme values better
- **Time-Based Components**: Add factors that consider historical trends (e.g., improving metrics over time)

```python
def rank_stocks_with_sector_adjustment(self, results):
    """Rank stocks with sector-specific weight adjustments."""
    # Group stocks by sector
    sector_groups = {}
    for result in results:
        sector = result.get('sector', 'Unknown')
        if sector not in sector_groups:
            sector_groups[sector] = []
        sector_groups[sector].append(result)
    
    # Apply sector-specific weights and ranking
    ranked_results = []
    for sector, sector_stocks in sector_groups.items():
        # Get appropriate weights for this sector
        weights = self._get_sector_weights(sector)
        # Rank within sector
        sector_ranked = self._apply_weighted_ranking(sector_stocks, weights)
        ranked_results.extend(sector_ranked)
    
    # Final global ranking
    ranked_results.sort(key=lambda x: x.get('overall_score', 0), reverse=True)
    
    # Add rank position
    for i, result in enumerate(ranked_results):
        result['rank'] = i + 1
        
    return ranked_results
```

### 3. Filtering System

**Current Implementation:**
- Clean filter function design with chainable methods
- Good range of filter options
- Clear documentation

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Compound Filters**: Add ability to create nested logical conditions (AND/OR)
- **Filter Presets**: Create savable filter combinations users can reuse
- **Value Ranges**: For numeric filters, provide auto-calculated meaningful ranges
- **Dynamic Filters**: Add filters that adapt based on the current dataset (e.g., top 10%)

```python
def filter_by_performance_percentile(self, metric, percentile=0.9):
    """Filter to keep only the top X% of stocks by a given metric."""
    if not self.filtered_results:
        return self
        
    # Calculate the percentile threshold
    valid_values = [r.get(metric, None) for r in self.filtered_results 
                   if r.get(metric) is not None]
    if not valid_values:
        return self
        
    threshold = np.percentile(valid_values, percentile * 100)
    
    # Apply the filter
    return self.apply_filter(
        lambda x: metric in x and x[metric] is not None and x[metric] >= threshold,
        f"Top {percentile * 100}% by {metric}"
    )
```

### 4. UI/UX

**Current Implementation:**
- Good organization with tabs and expandable sections
- Interactive filtering controls
- Basic visualizations

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Scan History**: Save previous scan results to compare over time
- **Comparison View**: Allow side-by-side comparison of selected stocks
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Add scatter plots, radar charts, and correlation matrices
- **Custom Tabs**: Let users create custom dashboard views with their preferred metrics
- **Export Options**: Add more export formats (Excel, PDF report)

```python
# Example of a comparison view implementation
def create_stock_comparison_view(selected_tickers, results):
    """Create a side-by-side comparison view of selected stocks."""
    if not selected_tickers or len(selected_tickers) < 2:
        st.warning("Select at least two stocks to compare")
        return
        
    # Find selected stocks in results
    comparison_stocks = [r for r in results if r['ticker'] in selected_tickers]
    
    # Create metric groups for comparison
    metric_groups = [
        {"name": "Technical", "metrics": ["tech_score", "signal", "above_ma40", "rsi"]},
        {"name": "Fundamental", "metrics": ["pe_ratio", "profit_margin", "revenue_growth"]},
        {"name": "Overall", "metrics": ["overall_score", "rank"]}
    ]
    
    # Create comparison table for each group
    for group in metric_groups:
        st.subheader(f"{group['name']} Comparison")
        
        # Create DataFrame for this group
        data = {}
        for stock in comparison_stocks:
            ticker = stock['ticker']
            data[ticker] = {metric: stock.get(metric, "N/A") for metric in group["metrics"]}
            
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)
        st.dataframe(df)
        
        # Add visualization for this group if appropriate
        if any(metric in ["tech_score", "overall_score", "pe_ratio"] for metric in group["metrics"]):
            create_comparison_chart(comparison_stocks, group["metrics"])
```

### 5. Performance Optimization

**Current Implementation:**
- Sequential processing of stocks
- Full recalculation on each scan

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- **Batch Processing**: Process stocks in parallel batches
- **Incremental Updates**: Only recalculate stocks with new data
- **Background Scanning**: Allow the UI to remain responsive during scanning
- **Data Prefetching**: Preload data for frequently accessed stocks

```python
def scan_stocks_batched(self, criteria, stock_list=None, progress_callback=None, batch_size=10):
    """Scan stocks in parallel batches for better performance."""
    # Determine which stocks to scan
    stocks_to_scan = stock_list or self._get_all_stocks()
    
    if not stocks_to_scan:
        return []
    
    # Process in batches
    results = []
    num_batches = (len(stocks_to_scan) + batch_size - 1) // batch_size
    
    for batch_idx in range(num_batches):
        start_idx = batch_idx * batch_size
        end_idx = min(start_idx + batch_size, len(stocks_to_scan))
        batch = stocks_to_scan[start_idx:end_idx]
        
        # Update progress
        if progress_callback:
            progress = batch_idx / num_batches
            progress_callback(progress, f"Processing batch {batch_idx+1}/{num_batches}")
        
        # Process this batch in parallel
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=batch_size) as executor:
            batch_results = list(executor.map(
                lambda ticker: self._process_single_stock(ticker, criteria),
                batch
            ))
        
        # Add non-None results
        results.extend([r for r in batch_results if r is not None])
    
    # Apply ranking if needed
    if criteria.get('strategy') == 'value_momentum' or criteria.get('combined_ranking'):
        results = self.rank_stocks(results)
    
    return results
```

### 6. Additional Features to Consider

1. **Market Context Analysis**: Incorporate overall market trends into the analysis (e.g., bull/bear market adjustments)

2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models to improve prediction accuracy based on historical performance

3. **Backtesting Framework**: Allow users to test their filtering and ranking strategies against historical data

4. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Consider signals across different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly)

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate news and social media sentiment into the stock ranking

6. **Scheduled Scanning**: Implement automatic periodic scanning with alerts for significant changes

7. **Portfolio Analysis**: Add features to analyze current holdings and suggest portfolio adjustments

## Implementation Priority

If you want to improve this scanner further, I suggest focusing on these areas first:

1. **Data Merging**: Improve how data from both databases is combined
2. **Parallel Processing**: Implement batched processing for better performance
3. **Advanced Visualizations**: Add more insightful charts and comparison views
4. **Sector-Specific Ranking**: Implement different ranking weights by sector
5. **Scan History**: Add the ability to save and compare scan results over time
