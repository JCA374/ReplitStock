Looking at the scanner code and documentation, I can see the current scanner uses the ValueMomentumStrategy to analyze stocks and display results. Let me suggest a redesign approach and then provide a simple notebook implementation.

## Suggested Redesign Options

I see two main approaches for redesigning the scanner:

**Option A: Enhanced Current Scanner**
- Keep the existing UI structure but improve the ranking system
- Add better filtering and sorting capabilities
- Simplify the watchlist integration

**Option B: Complete Redesign with New Ranking System**
- Create a new comprehensive scoring system
- Redesign the UI to focus on ranking and easy watchlist management
- Add more fundamental and technical metrics

I recommend **Option B** - a complete redesign that creates a cleaner, more focused stock ranking and watchlist management experience.

Here's a step-by-step notebook implementation:

This enhanced scanner design provides:

## Key Improvements:

1. **Comprehensive Scoring System**: 
   - Combines technical (40%), fundamental (30%), momentum (20%), and quality (10%) scores
   - Creates a single 0-100 score for easy ranking

2. **Better Ranking**: 
   - Stocks are automatically ranked from best to worst
   - Clear visual indicators (✓/✗) for key metrics

3. **Simplified Watchlist Integration**:
   - Quick-add buttons for top performers
   - Multi-select interface for bulk additions
   - Target any watchlist from the dropdown

4. **Enhanced UI**:
   - Clean, modern interface with progress indicators
   - Filtering options (score, signal, top N)
   - Top 5 performers highlighted section

## To Implement:

1. **Create the new scanner tab file**:
   ```python
   # tabs/enhanced_scanner_tab.py
   # Copy the code from the artifact above
   ```

2. **Update app.py**:
   ```python
   # Replace in the tabs dictionary:
   "Stock Scanner": render_enhanced_scanner_ui,
   ```

3. **Import the new scanner**:
   ```python
   from tabs.enhanced_scanner_tab import render_enhanced_scanner_ui
   ```

Would you like me to create the actual implementation files or would you prefer to see any specific part of the design modified first?
