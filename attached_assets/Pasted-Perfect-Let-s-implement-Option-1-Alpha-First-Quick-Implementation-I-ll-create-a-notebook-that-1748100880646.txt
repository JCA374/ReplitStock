Perfect! Let's implement **Option 1: Alpha-First Quick Implementation**. I'll create a notebook that shows the key changes needed to prioritize Alpha Vantage while adding safety measures for Yahoo Finance fallback.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for the **Alpha-First Quick Implementation**. Here's what this notebook covers:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Changes Implemented**

### **1. Alpha Vantage as Primary** (Cell 1)
- Changed default `preferred_data_source` from `'yahoo'` to `'alphavantage'`
- Added intelligent cache TTL based on API costs (fundamentals: 48h, daily: 6h, etc.)

### **2. Safe Yahoo Finance Fallback** (Cell 2)
- Added `YahooRateLimiter` class with proper rate limiting
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic
- Added conservative rate limits (60 calls/minute, 1s between calls)

### **3. Intelligent Data Routing** (Cell 3)
- Data-type-specific freshness checks
- Enhanced caching logic that considers API costs
- Better error handling with stale data fallback

### **4. Quota Management** (Cell 4)
- New `AlphaVantageQuotaManager` class to track API usage
- Daily and per-minute quota tracking
- Prevents unexpected API failures

### **5. UI Updates** (Cell 6)
- Updated API settings to show Alpha Vantage as recommended
- Real-time quota display in the UI
- Better user guidance

## ðŸš€ **Immediate Benefits**

1. **More Reliable Data**: Alpha Vantage provides consistent, high-quality data
2. **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent caching reduces expensive Alpha Vantage calls
3. **Failure Protection**: Yahoo Finance fallback won't break due to rate limits
4. **Quota Awareness**: Users can see their API usage and plan accordingly
5. **Better Performance**: Smarter caching means faster responses

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

Would you like me to:

1. **Create specific file patches** showing exactly what lines to change in each file?
2. **Add monitoring/logging** to track which data source is being used?
3. **Implement bulk optimization** for the scanner to minimize API calls?
4. **Add configuration for different Alpha Vantage plan tiers** (free vs premium)?

The implementation prioritizes Alpha Vantage while ensuring your app remains robust and cost-effective!
